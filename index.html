    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Haziq Hassan, a passionate and detail-oriented Data Analyst with a strong foundation in analyzing and interpreting complex datasets to drive actionable insights. My expertise lies in using tools like Excel, Python, and Tableau to uncover trends, optimize processes, and support data-driven decision-making. </p>
    <p> I specialize in using data to uncover patterns, solve complex problems, and support strategic decision-making. My analytical toolkit is built around Python, where I regularly leverage libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical analysis, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for applying machine learning models. Whether it's cleaning messy datasets, visualizing trends, or building predictive models, I enjoy every step of the data analysis process.</p>
    <p> In my recent personal portfolio projects, I’ve applied machine learning techniques such as regression and classification to real-world problems — from forecasting sales and identifying key customer segments to detecting anomalies in operational data. I take pride in delivering insights that are not only technically sound but also clearly communicated and actionable for stakeholders.</p>
    <p> I also work with SQL for data querying, Tableau and Power BI for interactive dashboards, and continuously explore new tools to expand my capabilities. I'm particularly interested in bridging the gap between data science and business, ensuring that the solutions I build are aligned with organizational goals and user needs.</p>
    <p> Now, I’m looking for new opportunities where I can contribute to data-driven teams, grow as an analyst, and help turn data into a strategic asset. If you're looking for someone who brings technical expertise, curiosity, and a strong problem-solving mindset — let’s connect.</p>
