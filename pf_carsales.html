      <p>The dashboard titled "Malaysia Vehicles Registration (January - March 2025)" provides a comprehensive overview of the country's vehicle registration trends for the first quarter of the year. The total number of registered vehicles during this period amounts to 198,378, reflecting a consistent upward trend across the three months. As illustrated by the line graph, registrations rose from approximately 53,000 in January to around 67,000 in February, reaching close to 77,000 by March. This steady increase suggests growing consumer activity or seasonal patterns influencing vehicle purchases.</p>

        <p>Vehicle types are broken down in the pie chart, revealing that motorcars account for the majority of registrations at 60.46%, followed by SUVs at 23.07%, and pick-up trucks at 4.36%. The dominance of motorcars indicates a continued preference for personal vehicles suitable for urban commuting and family use. The presence of SUVs and pick-up trucks, though smaller, still represents a significant portion, possibly pointing to rural usage or lifestyle preferences.</p>
        
        <p>The bar chart displaying vehicle colour preferences shows a clear inclination toward neutral tones. Grey is the most popular colour, with over 50,000 registrations, followed by white and silver. Bright or unconventional colours like pink, purple, gold, and yellow have minimal representation, implying conservative colour choices among Malaysian consumers. This trend could be influenced by resale value considerations, aesthetic preferences, or cultural factors.</p>
        
        <p>Regarding fuel type, the overwhelming majority of vehicles run on petrol, with registrations far outpacing all other categories. Hybrid petrol, greendiesel, electric, and diesel vehicles each account for only a small fraction of the total. This suggests that while there may be growing interest in alternative fuel sources, Malaysia’s vehicle market in early 2025 remains heavily dependent on conventional petrol engines. It also highlights potential opportunities and challenges for policymakers and manufacturers aiming to increase the adoption of greener technologies.</p>
        
        <p>The sales data for the most sold cars in Malaysia further highlights Perodua’s dominant position in the market. All three top-selling models—Bezza (23,335 units), Axia (21,223 units), and Myvi (18,183 units)—are manufactured by Perodua, reflecting its strong brand appeal and alignment with consumer preferences for affordable, fuel-efficient, and compact vehicles. In terms of total units sold by car makers, Perodua leads significantly with 85,091 units, followed by Proton with 34,227 units and Toyota with 26,175 units. While Proton and Toyota maintain a notable presence, their figures are markedly lower than Perodua’s, indicating the latter’s widespread market penetration. The dominance of Perodua in both model and brand sales suggests that Malaysian buyers prioritize value and practicality, making Perodua the preferred choice across a wide consumer base.</p>
        
        <p>The first quarter of 2025 reveals a healthy growth in vehicle registrations, driven primarily by motorcars and dominated by petrol-powered units. Consumer preferences show a clear trend toward conventional vehicle colours and fuel types. These insights provide valuable guidance for automotive stakeholders, including manufacturers, dealers, and policymakers, especially those working on transitioning toward sustainable transport options.</p>
