      <p>The Global Cybersecurity Threats Dashboard (2015–2024) provides a comprehensive overview of major trends in cybersecurity incidents worldwide. Over the past decade, there have been a total of 3,000 reported cyberattacks, impacting more than 1.5 billion users and resulting in financial losses of approximately $151.5 billion. On average, organizations take around 36 days to resolve cybersecurity incidents. The trend of cyberattacks shows a general increase over time, peaking around 2017–2018, with a slight decline in 2019, followed by another surge during the 2020–2022 period, likely influenced by the rapid shift to remote work environments during the pandemic.</p>

        <p>The primary sources of cyberattacks are nation-states (26.5%), insiders (25.1%), hacker groups (22.9%), and unknown entities (25.6%). This distribution emphasizes that internal threats are nearly as significant as external ones. In terms of attack types, the most common methods include nation-state activities, DDoS attacks, phishing, SQL injection, ransomware, and malware, with no single technique dominating completely. This diversity highlights the need for organizations to prepare against a wide variety of threat vectors.</p>
        
        <p>Vulnerabilities most frequently exploited by attackers include zero-day vulnerabilities (26.2%), weak passwords, unpatched software, and social engineering tactics. These findings suggest that basic cybersecurity hygiene, such as regular software updates and strong password policies, remains crucial for defense. On the protection side, the most commonly employed defense mechanisms are antivirus software (21%), VPNs (20.4%), encryption, firewalls, and AI-based detection systems, indicating that a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity is essential.</p>
        
        <p>Geographically, the countries most affected by cyberattacks include the United Kingdom, Brazil, India, Japan, and France, with notable incidents also reported in the USA and China. In terms of industry targets, IT, banking, healthcare, retail, education, and telecommunications sectors are among the hardest hit, reflecting attackers' focus on industries with high-value data and critical services.</p>
        
        <p>Overall, the dashboard highlights the evolving and complex nature of cybersecurity threats globally. It stresses the urgent need for organizations to adopt proactive, adaptive security strategies that address both traditional vulnerabilities and emerging threats. Strengthening internal security policies, investing in advanced defense technologies, and fostering cybersecurity awareness among employees will be crucial in mitigating future risks.</p>
